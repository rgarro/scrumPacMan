Play TicTacToe against Raptor TDD AI.

One players who take turns against simple TDD AI  marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid, one with Xs and the other with Os. A player wins when they mark all three spaces of a row, column, or diagonal of the grid, whereupon they traditionally draw a line through those three marks to indicate the win
